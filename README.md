This is an RShiny dashboard created by Lauren Bell to practice layout, data viz, and ML. The data used is mock cancer data from 
this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/cancer-patient-data-in-denmark

Some features:
 * bar charts of the number of cases treated with different cancer treatments and
   the distribution of cancer stages across diagnoses in a selected cancer type
 * (in progress still) survival time calculator that takes input data and returns an estimation of surivival time in months
 * currently working on different ways to visualize the data!
